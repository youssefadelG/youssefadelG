## Hi there, I'm Youssef Mahdy 👋

# 🌱 Growth-driven DevOps Engineer

# ✨ Overview

Automation & DevOps enthusiast with 5+ years of hands-on experience in cloud operations, CI/CD, software automation testing, and troubleshooting production Linux servers.

Passionate about building reliable, scalable systems — whether through infrastructure as code with Terraform, container orchestration with Kubernetes, automation with Ansible and Python, or crafting robust CI/CD pipelines .

I take ownership, dig deep into issues, and constantly look for smarter, cleaner ways to get things done.
